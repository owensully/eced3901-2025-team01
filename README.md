# Team #01 Robot Project ECED3901 2025 
This project pilots a robot to complete a series of challenges while avoiding obstacles along the way. As a part of Dalhousie University's ECED 3901: Electrical Engineering Design II course, the program will be used to complete the *RoboHeist* challenge.
# Background
## *RoboHeist*

The course which the robot will traverse can be seen above. The objective of the *RoboHeist* is to collect as much "loot" as possible. While some pieces of loot are lying on the floor, other pieces require the robot to complete special challenges to collect.
### Beam Break
To access the higher value loot,  the robot must first bypass an IR sensor without triggering it. If the IR sensor is triggered it will activate an alarm. The alarm can be shut off by navigating to the breaker and shutting it off. 
### Safe
One high-value piece of loot is locked away in a safe. The robot must interface with a dial on the safe and input the correct code to trigger it. 
### Indiana Jones 
Another high-value piece of loot is protected by an *Indiana Jones* style challenge, where the loot must be "replaced" by another object, so that the sensor never detects that the loot was moved.
### The Cage
The final piece of high-value loot is locked within a cage. This cage **must** be opened using the RFID Scanner on the wall
